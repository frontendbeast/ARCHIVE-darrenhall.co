		<h2>I&rsquo;m a freelance frontend developer based in Manchester.</h2>

    <h3>Test Driven Development</h3>
    <p>Mocha and Chai are my go to test tools, but I have also used Jasmine and Karma. I have some experience using BackstopJS to create automated visual regression tests.</p>
		<h3>Experienced with WordPress and Craft CMS</h3>
		<p>I have previously worked with extensively with WordPress, and more recently with Craft CMS. My previous work as an Object-Oriented PHP developer with CakePHP, CodeIgniter and Symfony allows me to get the most out of these systems.</p>
		<h3>Sitecore and Umbraco&nbsp;friendly</h3>
		<p>Many of the projects I have worked on in the last few years used a .NET CMS, and I am skilled at working with both Sitecore and Umbraco. I am adept at integrating Razor templates and have a working knowledge of editing controllers and tests.</p>
		<h2>Currently available from May</h2>
		<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in working with me then I&rsquo;d love to hear from you! I&rsquo;m currently available from the middle of May 2018. </p>
